# Redesign [the member web page](https://engineering.purdue.edu/HELPS/People)
The original information is kept in the redesigned web page. The composing style is that the paragraph is located the left side of web occupying 70 percent of the page and the image is set at the rest of page. The personal paragraph is parallel with the related image. It makes the web page look tidy.
This is the link to [the redesigned web page](../Member/Member.htm).

## Future improvements

If the newly-designed page is good, add the new member information to the web page and change the other web pages a little bit to comply with the new style.
